### Overview
This GitHub repo contains R code relevant to the NASA wildfire smoke project and is specific to our work on 2012 health data from Washington State. 

This project uses protected health information. Therefore, data files are not available due to data use agreements with Washington State Health Department.

For the Washington state wildfire project, it can be divided in to code for 2 papers at this time. The first is a morbidity paper using zipcode level exposure. The second is a morbidity/mortality paper using county level exposure.

There is also a seperate repository for 2015 health data as well as repositories for other states that I have health data on. I will likely consolidate all my project code.
